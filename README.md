Amazon Sales Analysis using python
## Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Amazon sales data using Python. The objective is to uncover insights, patterns, and trends in the sales data to inform business decisions and strategies.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA involves the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Handling missing values.
    - Correcting data types.
    - Removing duplicates.
    - Parsing dates and extracting relevant features (e.g., month, year, day).
2. **Data Visualisation**:
    - Sales trends over time.
    - Most popular products.
    - Sales distribution across different regions.
    - Correlation between different variables.
3. **Insights and Findings**:
    - Identifying peak sales periods.
    - Analysing customer purchasing behaviour.

## Results

The findings from the analysis are summarised in the final section of the main notebook and include visualisations such as:

- Line charts showing sales trends.
- Bar charts of top-selling products.
- Histogram and scattered plots of sales distribution by Cloth sizes.
